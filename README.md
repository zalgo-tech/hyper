# Hyper
A toolkit for creating 2D/3D games, based on [*insert backends here*].

## IMPORTANT
**Hyper is not currently in active development.** The idea for Hyper was a *Godot-style* game engine with *lower-level programming* support (c++) and a *less messy framework.* HOWEVER, the developer who formulated this idea (https://github.com/jammy3662) does not have the knowledge and skill to write a game engine alone, or from scratch. Additionally, the same developer also wanted to search for possible alternatives that meet the same criteria as Hyper, diverting the need to code an entirely new game engine/toolkit. Because of these few reasons, Hyper is on standby until further notice.

## Project Structure
As of the current version, Hyper is not a game engine itself, but rather a collection of software tied together in a modular, simple structure to abstract away the meticulous detail of creating games and let you focus on simply implementing the desired behavior of your game.
