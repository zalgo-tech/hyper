# Hyper
A 2D/3D Game Engine.

## Project Structure
The hyper game engine consists of several modules. Each module is found in its own directory, being a subdirectory of the project root. Some examples for modules are the rendering module or the core (ECS) module. In the source folder of the project root, the game engine itself is found. This includes glue code, a library containing all hyper-modules and tooling for setting up and building your hyper projects.
